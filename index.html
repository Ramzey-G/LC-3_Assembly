<p>Here you can find my programs written in LC-3 Assembly. The LC-3 is a computer (Little Computer 3) that is used for educational purposes to teach students how to program in Assembly. I was introduced to the LC-3 in an Engineering course at UC Santa Cruz.</p>

<p>Programming for the LC-3 or any type of Assembly Language can be very tedious. Assembly is a low level language which gives the programmer direct access to the hardware. For the LC-3 It was crucial to know how much memory I was working with, along with the type of CPU Architecture. More information on LC-3 Specifications can be found below. For me, these programs have enhanced my ability to break down real world problems in simple mathematics. </p>

<p>For a basic view of my LC-3 code feel free to check out my projects on the Github project button at the upper right this page. If you would like to run and view code in the appropriate Assembler* for the LC-3  read on.</p>

<p>In order to run these programs the LC-3 Simulator must be used. this simulator is an emulator which emulates the hardware of an LC-3. With this simulator, users are able to run through their program step by step, run through the program as a whole, or run through the program until a break point is reached. The LC-3 simulator works best on Windows, however a UNIX version does exist. Both downloads can be found <a href="http://highered.mheducation.com/sites/0072467509/student_view0/lc-3_simulator.html">here.</a> </p>

<p>Once the set up is complete you can find the LC3Edit application which allows you to view code along with the Stimulate application which allows you to run the program. To run a specific program go to File &gt; load program and select the appropriate source code file you would like to run. Now you will be able to view the address in memory of each line of code denoted by the hex numbers on the left. The blue arrow indicates the PC (Program Counter) which indicates the next line the of code the LC-3 is going to compute. To run the program hit the run button which is to the right of the folder icon</p>

<p>*Assembly languages are written in Assemblers, not Compilers.</p>

<h3>
<a id="lc-3-architecture" class="anchor" href="#lc-3-architecture" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>LC-3 Architecture:</h3>

<ul>
<li>RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) architecture. This means the computer does not have many commands. (19 usable)</li>
<li>16 Bit data and address (each command uses 16 bits of storage. See how it works in the LC3 ISA png in the repository)</li>
<li>8 General Purpose Registers (GPR)</li>
<li>4 special-purpose registers:

<ul>
<li>Program Counter (PC)- points to the address of the next line of code that is to be executed by the Assembler</li>
<li>Instructin Register (IR)</li>
<li>Condition Code Register(CC)</li>
<li>Process Status Register(PSR)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>16 kb of memory (RAM)</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a id="lc-3-commands" class="anchor" href="#lc-3-commands" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>LC-3 Commands:</h3>

<p>There is a limit of 19 usable commands (Instructions) which can be seen in the Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)
Some commands include:</p>

<ul>
<li>ADD - adds 2 registers together</li>
<li>ADD - can be used to add one register and one value (immediate)</li>
<li>TRAP - used only for I/O.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a id="lc-3-isa" class="anchor" href="#lc-3-isa" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>LC-3 ISA</h3>

<p>In order to understand the ISA.png in the repository, one must understand how the opcode (specific instruction or command) works with 16 bit data. The first four bits of each line of memory and code contain the instruction's opcode. From here the commands vary. Here are some useful abbreviations used for the LC-3 ISA:</p>

<ul>
<li>DR- Destination Register. This is the register in which the result of this command will be stored in. (Try to think of        registers like variables)</li>
<li> SR1 - Source Register 1. This is the register that is being used in the command.</li>
<li>
<p>SR2 - Source Register 2. This is the second register that is being used in the command. </p>

<ul>
<li>EX: ADD R0, R1, R2 ; //adds contents of register 1 and register 2 and stores it into register. R1 is SR1, R2 is SR2 and R0 is the DR</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>PCoffset9- This is used when telling the LC-3 to move the Program Counter (PC) to a specific line of code. This label must be no greater than 9 bits</li>
</ul>
